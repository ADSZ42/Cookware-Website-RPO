## Comments  

### General Feedback  
- The font is inconsistent for some text.  
- There are margin issues on the left and right sides of the main content.  

### Specific Issues  

1. **Navbar**  
   - The navbar is oversized.  

2. **Start Cooking Section**  
   - The zoom effect bleeds over the text.  
     - Recommendation: Use a container with `overflow: hidden`.  

3. **Best Sellers Section**  
   - The zoom effect bleeds over the text.  
     - Recommendation: Use a container with `overflow: hidden`.  
   - The text also bleeds through the box.  

4. **Reviews Section**  
   - The layout is offset, and the text box isnâ€™t centered.  

5. **Footer**  
   - There are slight margin issues.  
     - Example: The "About Our Home" section is too far from the left side of the screen.  

6. **Responsiveness**  
   - The same issues mentioned above persist in the responsive design.  
   - Many elements stretch or bleed, especially on mobile.  

### Final Thoughts  
There are many areas to improve, particularly with responsiveness and layout. Try focusing on the mobile page to address these issues.
